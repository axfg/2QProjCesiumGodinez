			<h3>What is BFT again?</h3>
			
			<p>
				As said in the home page:
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Basic Finance Tools is a website that contains several tools that can help you with your personal finance.
				These tools can help one to visualize and manage one's personal finance habits.
				This website is for people who are completely new to personal finance, since the tools shown here help only with the fundamentals.
				Also, there are much better alternatives to this website.

			<h3>Who created BFT and why was it created?</h3>

				The creator of BFT wishes to stay anonymous.

			<h3>How should BFT be used?</h3>
			
			<p>
				BFT is intended to be used for short calculations and planning.
				BFT is meant to set guidelines and remind you about your habits.
				It should not be used to make long-term plans, or displace any of them (unless said long-term plan is unhealthy for you).
			</p>

		<div class = "bar"></div>
		
		<section class = "text">
			<h3>Why Use BFT specifically?</h3>
			
			<p>
				There is no special reason to use BFT. There are other finance websites in the internet, with better functionality.
				BFT is simply a school project and the creator does not recommend it for serious use.
